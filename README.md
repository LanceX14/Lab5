# YAF
   YAF is the expansion of "you and friend". This program could let you enter two features and then compare them.
   ## Usage
   Open YAF.ipynb, follow the instructions and enter your information and your friend's information in turn, and then you can get feedback.

   Example: your age = 19 and your friend is 19, then input the information and get "What a coincidence! you guys are same age!".
   ## Contributing
   To contribute, you can directly access and add new properties(such as educational background or height), then please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
