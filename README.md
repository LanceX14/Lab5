# YAF
   YAF is the expansion of "you and friend". This program could let you enter two features and then compare them.
   ## Usage
   (Open YAF.ipynb, follow the instructions and enter your information and your friend's information in turn, and then you can get feedback.)
   ```python
   Please input your name! # input "LANCE"
   Your age please! # input 19
   what's your job?? # input "student"
   # return "Lance who is 19 is a student"
   your BFF name? # input "Tom"
   his/her age? # input 19
   his/her job? # input "student"
   # return "Tom who is 19 is a student"
   # return "what a coincidence! You guys are same age!"
   # return "what a coincidence! You guys have same job!"

   ```

   (In example above: your age = 19 and your friend is 19, then input the information and get "What a coincidence! you guys are same age!".)
